        <div>
            <p>
                Welcome to Catopia, where our mission is to provide a loving and caring environment for cats in need.
                We prioritize ethical practices like enforcing spays/neuters on all cats and ensuring they have
                enough space to roam and are not kept in dense populations. We assess potential owners' home lives to match them
                with suitable feline companions to prevent cats from being adopted out to unfit homes.
                Catopia occasionally hosts community charity events to raise funds for our cause. These events are free to attend,
                but we encourage donations to support the shelter's operations and the well-being of our kitties.

        <p class="question">"How do you take donations?"</p>
        <p class="answer">
            We greatly appreciate and accept all kinds of donations! Most donations (food, beds, toys, even money) can be dropped
            off at the shelter during regular open hours and charity events. If you'd like to donate without visting, please give us a call.

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="question">"How can I adopt a cat from Catopia?"</p>
        <p class="answer">
            Adopting from Catopia simply involves filling out an application and meeting the cat you wish to adopt, but there
            is payment involved in order to cover veterinary fees. Each cat is neutered, microchipped, and fully up-to-date on 
            vaccinations as well as socialized and potentially fostered during their stay at Catopia. We also include a small 
            adoption fee in order to keep our shelter running. Most cats will total $400, but ones who have already been through
            these medical expenses prior to arrival at Catopia may cost much less.
