# Catopia
## Introduction
Catopia is a feline refuge located in Washington with the primary goal of intaking, rehabilitating, and rehoming cats with nowhere to stay.   
This website is being built by myself, Teddy Bushnell, for a project in my .NET web programming course at CPTC (FALL 2023).
<br />

#### Planned Features:
* Browse a catalog of cats available for adoption to find the purrfect companion.
* View detailed information about each cat, including name, age, breed, personality, and any medical notes.
* Fill out an adoption application for a specific cat.
* Find resources and educational information on taking care of a cat.
* Learn about the shelter's mission and how to get involved or donate!
* Admin account privileges such as modifying cat listings and creating news articles.
